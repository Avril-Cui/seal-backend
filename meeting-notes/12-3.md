# Meeting Agenda — 12/3, 1PM

## Progress Report: How Last Week Went / Alignment to Development Plan

- Sessioning via backend syncs instead of original frontend-only syncs  
- Removing password from the `UserProfile` concept  
- Extension fully functional, serves as a second frontend basically  
- Pitch critique/feedback pretty much solved  
- For cold starts, deploy backend on Deno instead of Render  
  - Make sure to point everything in the frontend towards the new backend URL  
- No major changes needed between user testing and demo/project report — just some polish  

## Design Changes Since Last Meeting

- Chrome extension made more minor — just another entry point/frontend to main app (Stanley)  
- Custom drawn pigs (Lauren)  
- Stats page now has actual AI insights (Avril)  
- Pause Cart now auto-scrapes from Amazon product pages  
  - Focus only on Amazon (Elaine)
