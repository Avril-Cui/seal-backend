# Meeting Agenda — 11/21, 3:30PM

## Progress Report: How Last Week Went / Alignment to Development Plan

- We met up to complete the functional design, discussing what concepts we needed.
- By Sunday, we aim to have most actions implemented in the backend for each of our sections.
- We will meet Sunday to review progress, then work on a scrappy frontend + backend integration to submit for our alpha checkpoint on Tuesday.

## Design Changes Since Last Meeting

- We began considering the possibility of a Chrome extension.
- We now have a mascot.

## Issues

### User Friction

People noted in the feedback form that manually stopping themselves while shopping and switching to BuyBye introduces friction.

- **Stretch idea:** Make a Chrome extension (or build alongside the website) for more seamless integration with sites like Amazon.
  - Example: Add an extra button on product pages that automatically adds an item to the BuyBye wishlist (instead of adding to cart).
  - **Concern:** Feasibility and time.
- Larger underlying issue: Users must distinguish impulsive wants vs. needs before choosing to use BuyBye — cognitive burden regardless of extension vs. standalone.
  - **Potential solution:** Chrome extension popup or text box with AI-generated feedback and/or statistics about the product to nudge users into sending the item to BuyBye instead of checkout.

### Security

We store users’ personal info (items they’re thinking of buying).

- **Stretch:** Hashing in the database.

### Out of Scope

- Tracking in-person purchases — we are focusing on online purchases, since evidence shows impulse purchases occur more frequently online.

## Plans & Decisions for Next Week

- Basic backend completed by Sunday.
- Integration + basic frontend completed by Tuesday for the Alpha checkpoint.
- We want to discuss and finalize decisions around the Chrome extension possibility and whether the community is global or friend-based.

## Open Questions

- Are we creating one global community, or restricting interactions to friends?
  - Do strangers have enough context to judge your purchase?
  - We provide reflection/reasoning in the swipes, but if users are incentivized to swipe quickly, why would strangers stop to read?
- We wish we had conducted real user interviews…
