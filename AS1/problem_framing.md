Online shopping: Online shopping is a daily habit for many people, offering convenience and excitement. Many people shop online and suffer from consumer retail therapy. While it is enjoyable to browse for cool products and compare deals, it's also easy to get caught in the moment and make impulse purchases that will later be regretted. This domain interests us because it allows us to boost the experience of something that a lot of people like ourselves do almost daily. This also helps fight against broader environmental problems involving overconsumption and overproduction. 

# Problem: Impulse Purchases
We chose this problem because impulse shopping is a common and relatable behavior that affects nearly everyone who shops online. Modern e-commerce platforms are intentionally designed to encourage instant decisions through flash sales, one-click checkout, and personalized recommendations, leaving little space for reflection. Addressing this problem offers both practical impact and technical feasibility. It can be tackled without requiring large-scale adoption or complex infrastructure, while still providing meaningful value to everyday consumers.

Here is an outline of the problems under impulse purchases our app will address:
1. Impulsive-Buying: When shopping online, people often make impulsive purchases on small accessories, limited-time deals, or “recommended for you” (essentially, products they never intended to buy if they actually think about them carefully). Although these items may bring brief satisfaction, they’re often unnecessary, and there’s no simple way to pause or reflect before completing the purchase. Distinguishing between what we need and what we merely want can be difficult in the moment. 
2. Informed Decision-Making: At the moment of purchase, shoppers rarely stop to consider whether an item is a true need or simply a want. Shoppers make decisions based on impulse, emotion, or fear of missing out rather than rational evaluation. There is no mechanism that encourages reflection or provides suggestions about the necessity of the purchase. As a result, shoppers lack awareness and accountability at the decision point, leading to regret, clutter, and overspending.
3. Cost-Tracking: Existing expense-tracking tools or online shopping are also too manual or tedious, leading many shoppers to skip logging their spending entirely after they make a purchase. As a result, shoppers lose awareness of how much of their money goes toward unplanned or impulsive buys.


# Evidence

1. [Scale of impulse purchases](https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/impulse-buying-statistics/): Nearly nine out of ten shoppers (89%) have made impulse purchases, with more than half (54%) having spent at least $100 on a single unplanned purchase. In 2024, consumers spent an average of $281.75 each month on impulse purchases. Shoppers make roughly 9.75 impulse purchases per month, averaging $28.90 per item. Although there was a market correction in impulse spending in 2023, the amount of spending is rebounded in 2024 and is expected to remain decently high in the years ahead .

2. [Price and discounts play major roles in driving impulse purchases.](https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/discount-statistics/) About 91% of Americans look for discounts before buying online, and 67% have made an unplanned purchase when presented with a discount. A product that offers a 20% discount is twice as likely to be purchased compared to its regular price. Coupons and sales significantly influence shoppers across all age groups, from 18 to over 57 years old.

4. The driving forces behind impulse purchase are complex, which is why it is so problematic to many shoppers. [Experts defined four types of impulse purchases](https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-to-avoid-impulse-buying/):
    - Pure impulse buying: Purchases driven by sudden emotions or urges, without prior intention
    - Reminder impulse buying: Purchases triggered when something reminds the shopper of a related need.
    - Suggestion impulse buying: Purchases influenced by marketing messages or recommendations.
    - Planned impulse buying: Purchases anticipated in advance, but motivated by discounts or promotions.

5. [Psychologists explain that emotional triggers drive impulse purchases.](https://time.com/6200717/online-shopping-psychology-explained/) For example, Jorge Barraza, program director and assistant professor in the online master of science in applied psychology program at the University of Southern California, said, “When we’re sad, when we’re stressed, we’re more likely to engage in this kind of behavior.” Nevertheless, in many cases, this spark of excitement from buying interesting items do not persist, especially when shoppers realized they have overspent their money.

    > For me it's typically games that I just buy and maybe play once. Worst part is I know this is probably going to happen before I buy it but I do it anyway.
    > I spent $4000 on a PC, $500 on a monitor, and another $250 on speakers for it. All that to play it once a week, maybe.
    > Oh, and a $800 43" TV. It technically is worth it since it's 4k 120Hz and Sony. But I don't really watch TV and clearly I'm not using it to play my video games.
    > Just spent £800 on a MacBook to start music production as a new hobby. All I’ve done is used it for Reddit.
