# Domain
Online shopping: Online shopping is a daily habit for many people, offering convenience and excitement. Many people shop online and suffer from consumer retail therapy. While it is enjoyable to browse for cool products and compare deals, it's also easy to get caught in the moment and make impulse purchases that will later be regretted. This domain interests us because it allows us to boost the experience of something that a lot of people like ourselves do almost daily. This also helps fight against broader environmental problems involving overconsumption and overproduction. 

# Problem: Impulse Purchases
We chose this problem because impulse shopping is a common and relatable behavior that affects nearly everyone who shops online. Modern e-commerce platforms are intentionally designed to encourage instant decisions through flash sales, one-click checkout, and personalized recommendations, leaving little space for reflection. Addressing this problem offers both practical impact and technical feasibility. It can be tackled without requiring large-scale adoption or complex infrastructure, while still providing meaningful value to everyday consumers.

Here is an outline of the problems under impulse purchases our app will address:
1. Impulsive-Buying: When shopping online, people often make impulsive purchases on small accessories, limited-time deals, or “recommended for you” (essentially, products they never intended to buy if they actually think about them carefully). Although these items may bring brief satisfaction, they’re often unnecessary, and there’s no simple way to pause or reflect before completing the purchase. Distinguishing between what we need and what we merely want can be difficult in the moment. 
2. Informed Decision-Making: At the moment of purchase, shoppers rarely stop to consider whether an item is a true need or simply a want. Shoppers make decisions based on impulse, emotion, or fear of missing out rather than rational evaluation. There is no mechanism that encourages reflection or provides suggestions about the necessity of the purchase. As a result, shoppers lack awareness and accountability at the decision point, leading to regret, clutter, and overspending.
3. Cost-Tracking: Existing expense-tracking tools or online shopping are also too manual or tedious, leading many shoppers to skip logging their spending entirely after they make a purchase. As a result, shoppers lose awareness of how much of their money goes toward unplanned or impulsive buys.


# Evidence

1. [Scale of impulse purchases](https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/impulse-buying-statistics/): Nearly nine out of ten shoppers (89%) have made impulse purchases, with more than half (54%) having spent at least $100 on a single unplanned purchase. In 2024, consumers spent an average of $281.75 each month on impulse purchases. Shoppers make roughly 9.75 impulse purchases per month, averaging $28.90 per item. Although there was a market correction in impulse spending in 2023, the amount of spending is rebounded in 2024 and is expected to remain decently high in the years ahead .

2. [Price and discounts play major roles in driving impulse purchases.](https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/discount-statistics/) About 91% of Americans look for discounts before buying online, and 67% have made an unplanned purchase when presented with a discount. A product that offers a 20% discount is twice as likely to be purchased compared to its regular price. Coupons and sales significantly influence shoppers across all age groups, from 18 to over 57 years old.

4. The driving forces behind impulse purchase are complex, which is why it is so problematic to many shoppers. [Experts defined four types of impulse purchases](https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-to-avoid-impulse-buying/):
    - Pure impulse buying: Purchases driven by sudden emotions or urges, without prior intention
    - Reminder impulse buying: Purchases triggered when something reminds the shopper of a related need.
    - Suggestion impulse buying: Purchases influenced by marketing messages or recommendations.
    - Planned impulse buying: Purchases anticipated in advance, but motivated by discounts or promotions.

5. [Psychologists explain that emotional triggers drive impulse purchases.](https://time.com/6200717/online-shopping-psychology-explained/) For example, Jorge Barraza, program director and assistant professor in the online master of science in applied psychology program at the University of Southern California, said, “When we’re sad, when we’re stressed, we’re more likely to engage in this kind of behavior.” Nevertheless, in many cases, this spark of excitement from buying interesting items do not persist, especially when shoppers realized they have overspent their money.

6. [Expert suggests that although many are impacted by impulse purchases, apps with the following features can help reduce impulse purchases:](https://aicompetence.org/stop-impulse-buying-with-smart-ai-apps/)
    - Customized spending alert
    - Clear insights into users’ financial health
    - Real-time updates

7. [Signs of impulsive shopping includes](https://www.verywellmind.com/difference-between-compulsive-and-impulsive-shopping-22336):
    - Spending more money than needed and intended
    - Browsing online shopping sites that often trigger impulsive purchases
    - Regret after purchase, and frequently returning impulse purchases

8. This [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1f6l1tk/what_impulse_purchases_have_you_made_that_you/) thread record the impulsive purchases people have made. It's clear than many of these purchases could have been prevented if someone else can give them can advise or guide them to second-think again.
    > For me it's typically games that I just buy and maybe play once. Worst part is I know this is probably going to happen before I buy it but I do it anyway.
    > I spent $4000 on a PC, $500 on a monitor, and another $250 on speakers for it. All that to play it once a week, maybe.
    > Oh, and a $800 43" TV. It technically is worth it since it's 4k 120Hz and Sony. But I don't really watch TV and clearly I'm not using it to play my video games.
    > Just spent £800 on a MacBook to start music production as a new hobby. All I’ve done is used it for Reddit.

## Comparables  
**Notes about existing solutions to the problem or related problems**

**Argument:** While there exist many popular solutions that solve tangential problems and some smaller apps that seek to solve some of these issues, no app exists today that comprehensively solves the concerns of our stakeholders.

### Related Problems  
It’s difficult to make decisions on what item to buy given so many different options online, and with many shopping experiences, there lacks feedback, comments, or opinions from other people in order to make more grounded decisions.

### Existing Solutions  
[Amazon](https://amazon.com) has reviews for each product to help make better decisions; however, while Amazon as a platform excels at convenience and personalization, it is at its core a platform deliberately optimized to increase consumption, e.g. through “Frequently Bought Together,” “Recommended for You,” and flash-sale banners. While Amazon and its review system makes purchasing seamless and more grounded in reasoning, it still amplifies impulsive behavior rather than help shoppers reflect on it.

While [Pinterest](https://pinterest.com) visually displays many items at once that are suited to users’ personal/aesthetic preferences and interests, there is a lack of feedback from other people on the quality of the items, as well as a lack of information on the credibility of the seller. With endless options, scrolling feeds, and even short-form videos, it’s easy to get lost in the platform for hours on end, again fueling impulsive behavior rather than helping to curb it.

### Similar Software Solutions Solving Our Problem  
Subreddit communities: [r/ShouldIBuyThis]() (98 members) and [r/ShouldIbuythisgame/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/) (1.5+ million members), [r/whatcarshouldIbuy](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/) (687K+ members)  
While these communities are tailored to fight impulse buying and induce more informed decision-making, it can take hours or even days to get meaningful responses. There is also no incentive for others to provide responses. Even then, these responses can be highly unstructured. There is also high friction to creating posts i.e., posting information about the item and specific considerations. There is also only high traffic on the more niche subreddits.

[Stop Impulse Buying](https://www.stopimpulse.com/)  
This app offers a no-spending challenge tracker and savings challenges designed to reduce impulse purchases. However, it functions largely as a static platform that delivers educational and motivational content. Its biggest limitation is the heavy reliance on manual user engagement — something many impulsive shoppers may find difficult to sustain.

[SpendWise](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spendwise-mindful-spending/id6496203443)  
This app tracks shopping carts and spending while motivating users to avoid impulse purchases by highlighting the money they’ve saved. However, it does not actively assist users in deciding whether an item is a “need” or a “want,” which is crucial to understand in order to address impulse purchases. Shoppers must still spend time reflecting on these decisions themselves, limiting the app’s effectiveness at the moment of purchase.

Google Sheets or [Notion](https://www.notion.com/templates/category/personal-finance)  
The limitation is that it costs time and effort to organize and update these templates every time a purchase is made, and it lacks a community aspect, only allowing us to make decisions based on past purchases and preferences.


# Features
We can up with some possible features to address the problem.

## PauseCart: Reflective shopping cart
One possible feature is a reflective shopping cart, where users can paste links to items they’re considering purchasing or import their existing carts from platforms like Amazon and other major e-commerce sites. Users also log the reason why they hope to purchase this item.

## SwipeSense: Community Swipe Preference
Another possible feature is Community Swipe Preferences, a social layer that introduces accountability and shared feedback into the shopping process. Users can upload or import items they’re considering buying and have them appear in an A/B comparison format for other users to swipe on, indicating which item other users think is more worthwhile or necessary. Alternatively, they can swipe to decide whether they think the purchase is worth it. In turn, users must complete their own daily swiping queue before their items become eligible for community feedback, ensuring balanced participation. This creates a fun, peer-based system that helps shoppers gain perspective on their decisions, see how others evaluate similar purchases, and develop more intentional buying habits through collective reflection.

## WalletWhisper: Personal Cost Tracking of Items Bought
A third feature is Personal Cost Tracking. Once an item is bought by the user, it’s added to a personal dashboard that tracks spending patterns and displays insights such as, “You purchased something that 40% of users predicted you might regret.” After receiving the item, users can log their thoughts or feedback: whether they’re satisfied, neutral, or regret the purchase. Over time, the system learns from these reflections, identifying trends in impulsive behavior and flagging similar future items as potential impulse buys. This feedback loop encourages mindful shopping habits by combining personal data, community insight, and behavioral learning.
