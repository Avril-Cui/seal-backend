# Updated Development Plan

## Progress

We have completed all core features of the application. The UI has been improved with custom pig profiles and additional optimizations to enhance the user experience. The Chrome extension is fully implemented and integrated with the main web app. We added AI-powered insights that provide analysis both per individual item in the PauseCart and as an overall summary across all purchases and non-purchases. The ItemCollection system was updated to accept Amazon links, as we've tailored the app specifically for Amazon products. Authentication and session management were implemented using a passthrough approach. For the stats pages, we completed the share/export statistics feature with a Spotify Wrapped-style presentation.

## What Remains to Be Done

The remaining work includes implementing algorithmic swiping that tailors product recommendations to users' interests based on what they selected during registration, fixing minor bugs to create a smoother user experience, and conducting user testing.

## How Our Plans Have Changed

The Chrome extension now plays a more minor role compared to the main web application, serving primarily as a convenient way to add Amazon products rather than being a core entry point. We narrowed our product scope to focus exclusively on Amazon items, which simplified the ItemCollection implementation and allowed us to provide a more consistent user experience. The AI insights feature, originally considered a stretch goal, became a priority as it proved valuable for helping users reflect on their purchasing decisions. We also deprioritized WalletWhisper and advanced gamified rewards to focus on delivering a polished PauseCart and SwipeSense experience. The Spotify Wrapped-style statistics export emerged as a fun, shareable feature that wasn't in our original plans but adds significant value to the user experience.
