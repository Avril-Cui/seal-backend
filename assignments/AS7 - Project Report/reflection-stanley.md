# Reflection
_A reflection on your experiences in the final project, focusing on what you learned from the experience, divided into a subsection for each team member._


The final project taught me about software engineering from a different perspective. I had never really understood it as a more broad perspective of this concept idea. I always thought of it as a very simple web architecture in the sense of sending and receiving requests, as opposed to breaking it down further with syncs and requesting and concepts and whatnot. I think this actually makes quite a lot of sense, more of a "side effect" emitting kind of approach that is useful for scaling. 

Something else I definitely learned and reinforced was the idea of modular iteration for code generation with LLMs. By providing a framework and limiting the context to what is enough to complete that component, the LLM performed a lot better as opposed to trying to oneshot many components at once.

Overall, I enjoyed the final project and I think our idea was a lot of fun to build. I think it was definitely something within our capabilities to build on our own without the aid of LLMs. I think having that aid made the process much faster and allowed us to think of the product more broadly. It also gave us a lot more creative freedom to simply add another feature we thought of because development was just so much faster.
