# Reflection - Lauren Yoo
_A reflection on your experiences in the final project, focusing on what you learned from the experience, divided into a subsection for each team member._

### Technical Learning
- This project helped solidify my understanding of the Requesting concept; I already had the basics from the individual project, but using again for this group project clarified how requests shape state changes in practice.
- Re-learned the importance of modular concepts. I initially thought from my individual project that global shared state was normal, but our mentor clarified that all states should remain isolated and interact through object IDs and syncs. This shifted how we approached implementation.
- Gained a better sense of how cross-concept interactions should be structured, especially in cases where multiple concepts rely on the same identifiers or sequences of actions.

### Design & Architecture Learning
- Feedback from mentoring meetings as well as project pitch feedback helped us identify parts of the design that were overly complicated or ambiguous and guided us toward cleaner, more consistent choices. For instance, we did not originally plan for a chrome extension, but after receiving feedback, prioritized it and assigned it as a full task for one person to implement.
- Iterating after product pitches helped refine the user experience and exposed gaps between what we intended and what the system actually supported.

### Teamwork & Process Learning
- Working in a team made the project feel much more concrete; dividing responsibilities meant each of us could focus more deeply on a smaller set of concepts. This division gave me more ownership and control over the quality of my part of the system, while also making me more aware of how my work affected others.
- Collaborating required clearer communication about assumptions, naming, and expected behaviors—something that, in an individual project, can be brushed over. Working in a group forced us to be more precise about everything we wrote/documented, which meant that we had to have a detailed and well thought out plan every time we went into the next stage of our project.
- Reviewing each other’s work and discussing design decisions helped broaden my understanding of the system beyond the parts I directly implemented.
