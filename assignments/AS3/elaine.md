# I Like
I really like the idea behind this project. It feels could be especially meaningful for people who struggle with memory, like folks with dementia or other neurological conditions. I also appreciate that you clearly acknowledged accessibility needs in your ethical analysis, since that is something many teams skip. The visual design stands out too. The warm and nostalgic color palette creates a really comforting environment for storytelling, and the timeline sketches feel natural for reflecting on personal history. Overall, the project has a thoughtful emotional core that matches the problem you identified.

# I Wish
I wish the project explored more multimedia options. Adding an audio feature could make memories feel even more alive and easier to capture, especially for users who prefer speaking over writing. I also wish there were more details about the approval flow you describe. For example, when a memory involves many people, how exactly does approval work? Does one unapproved tag block the whole post, or does it still appear for the creator while staying hidden from others? I also wish the navigation tools went beyond a linear timeline. People will accumulate a lot of memories over time, so even early ideas for alternative views or filters could help avoid future friction.

# I Wonder
I’m wondering how you plan to gain critical mass. Will people need to fully register before they can view or collaborate on a memory, or can they participate through something link-based, similar to Zoom, without creating an account? I’m also wondering about privacy. Since this app handles deeply personal data, very similar to Facebook’s level of sensitivity, how will you guarantee safety and storage practices that users can trust? And at scale, I’m curious how users will explore large collections of memories across many groups. An intelligent search feature, like typing “memories on the beach,” or another non-timeline way of browsing could help people find stories even when they don’t remember the exact time or the exact people involved.
