# Peer Critique - Team CHLK - Lauren Yoo

## What are some aspects of the project that you like, and why? *

- As someone who has hopped from journaling app to journaling app due to personal dissatisfaction with each of them, I really like how the project frames memories as objects that are collaborative rather than personal! The emphasis you're putting on the idea of shared storytelling turns the product into something that functions more as an engaging social activity that can strengthen bonds, which differentiates it from typical journaling apps.
- Awesome job with your ethical analysis! (1) I think the consideration of future emotional contexts (e.g., break-ups, grieving loved ones who have passed, etc.) is a really thoughtful addition. It's great that you're thinking not just about short-term engagement, but also more in the long term, considering how memories evolve and change over time. (2) It's great that you're considering early-on in your design the possibility of bullying/hate-speech that could occur on the app, and how that could be dealt with.
- Love the Spotify Wrapped-inspired feature! I think people are really into the whole year review/summary idea in general, hence why we see Spotify Wrapped-inspired things on other platforms (e.g. BeReal, Reddit Recap, etc.); it's fun looking back at how your experiences have evolved over time.

## What are some aspects of the project that you wish were different in some way? *

- I know you're already doing a lot, but I was wondering if it would be feasible to think about adding other forms of media, such as video or voice memo, or maybe integrating with Spotify or something so that people can associate songs or playlists with a memory.
- Some of the ethical responses currently feel reactive (e.g., “If you get reported too much for propaganda/disinformation/bullying/hate-speech, your stories get limited to friends-only”), and I’d love to see your team come up with more proactive safety features that could prevent harm earlier in the pipeline rather than after harmful content has already done its damage.
- You mentioned you would "[i]mplement clear consent mechanisms before sharing or tagging others in memories," but how does this work if a user forgets to request consent from another user, or if they maliciously choose not to, and simply post pictures of other people without asking for their permission?
- What happens when consent was requested from someone to upload your memory, but this person doesn't want to be included in the memory? Does this mean that you have to go in and manually edit out all mentions of them? And if so, how does the app ensure that they follow through with the requested changes?
- (I want to acknowledge that I do think that points 2-4 above are perhaps not too big of an issue, as it seems your app is more designed for close friends to scrapbook together, so hopefully there isn't that much malicious intent in the first place.)

## What are some aspects you are wondering about; perhaps some suggestions for a simplification, a different approach, or whatever? *

- What happens when multiple contributors want to edit the same memory at the same time? Will there be a version log? Or will it be like a Google Docs?
- As mentioned above, when someone is tagged in a memory, is “tag approval” a simple yes/no, or can they request redaction, partial visibility, or specific modifications? Nuanced options could help reduce conflict while keeping collaboration intact.
- Are there going to be any options for people who want to use this platform as their primary journaling platform? i.e., is there going to be a way for people to privately post their own memories just for themselves to see, so that they don't need to have a separate journaling app for logging their own thoughts/private memories?
