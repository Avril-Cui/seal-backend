# Updated Development Plan

## Progress

We updated our Concept and Sync specifications to address Eagon’s feedback about shared generic types and the conflation of responsibilities inside UserAuth. UserAuth now strictly manages authentication state (a set of registered users with `uid`, `email`, and `password`), while the new UserProfile concept owns all profile-related information for each `uid`, including name, profile picture, FieldsOfInterests, and reward points. UserProfile is completely independent from credentials and simply receives the `uid` generated by signup. We also removed all globally shared generic types and instead defined each type inside the concept that owns it. ItemCollection now defines Items, UserProfile defines Users, and SwipeSystem and QueueSystem operate entirely on opaque identifiers like `uid` and `itemId`. This ensures that concepts no longer share or mutate each other’s state and communicate only through IDs rather than shared objects. So, our concepts should be modular now!

We have implemented all concepts and syncs according to these updated specifications. We also wrote test cases for each concept, and all test cases should be passing with `deno test -A`. In addition, we created a Chrome Extension MVP that lets users save Amazon products to their ByeBuy wishlist directly from the product page. Built with React, Tailwind, and Vite, it injects a floating “Add to ByeBuy Wishlist” button and scrapes detailed metadata such as title, price, images, description, ASIN, and specifications. Currently, the extension logs the metadata to the console, and we plan to integrate it with the backend in future iterations.

We also built a scrappy frontend MVP that covers the full ByeBuy experience: signup and login, selecting interests, managing a reflective wishlist through PauseCart, swiping on others’ items through SwipeSense, viewing statistics, and editing profile and settings. Items support reflection prompts like “need vs want” and “future-you approval,” and the UI displays queue progress and estimated money saved. All user state is currently simulated locally using techniques such as localStorage to mimic backend integrations. We also added features like a mock Pig mascot and a colorblind accessibility toggle. Both the backend and frontend are deployed on Vercel and accessible through public URLs.

## What Remains to Be Done

We still need to fully connect the frontend to the backend by replacing all localStorage mocks with real API calls to the concepts and syncs for authentication, wishlist operations, queue generation, swiping, and statistics. This is partially done with some frontend connected with the backend server, but we need to finalize our backend syncs and make sure frontend is completely integrated with the backend.

We must also integrate the Chrome extension’s scraped metadata into the backend’s ItemCollection rather than logging it locally. Additional remaining tasks include refining the behavior of daily queues and community statistics—such as determining unlock thresholds, handling small sample sizes, and validating against spammy or extremely fast swipes. We also need to add the AI feedback endpoint that invokes `getAIInsight` and implement its frontend UI. Finally, the deployed app requires a round of usability improvements and bug fixes, including accessibility reviews, mobile responsiveness adjustments, and clearer loading and error states.

We also need to finalize using the AmazonAPI to fetch data related to an item's url. We currently mocked the effect of AmazonAPI, but we will look into implementing this for Beta checkpoint. Our idea is that if AmazonAPI doesn't work, we will use our Chrome extension to automatically scrape the item information, which will provide the same smooth user experience. If that's the case, we will update our frontend UI so that instead of asking users to paste an URL, we give users the option to manually add an item to their Pause Cart.

## How Our Plans Have Changed

Originally, our project plan included three major features—PauseCart, SwipeSense, and WalletWhisper—along with advanced analytics and gamified rewards. Given time constraints and implementation complexity, we shifted our focus to delivering a polished, end-to-end experience for PauseCart and SwipeSense as the core features. WalletWhisper and richer reward mechanics have been moved to stretch-goal status. Additionally, our planning shifted toward using the Chrome extension as a primary and realistic entry point into ItemCollection, which influenced how we prioritize backend integration and final development tasks.
